class RemailSelector:
    """
    Find all documents in a particular class which must be remailed.

    Finds the content documents, including the version number, and
      the tracking documents for the mailer which received no response

    Stores info temporarily in database tables.

    Selects:
       Latest publishable version of document for which:
       A mailer was sent between
          Some number of days (60 is expected)
          and some other number (120 is expected)
          (e.g., examines all mailers sent between 2 and 4
           months ago.)
       The mailer is the requested type, i.e., one of the
          non-remailer types.
       No response to the mailer was received.
       No remailer has already been sent.
    The selection also retrieves the id of the mailer tracking document
       for the previous mailer - to be used in the RemailerFor element
       in the new Mailer tracking document for this remailer.

    Several temporary tables are used, primarily to simplify and
      significantly speed up the selections.

        Parameters:
            originalMailType = String containing original mailer types,

              mailer types CIPS may never have sent remailers, and we
              probably don't want to follow up on old, unanswered mailers
              that are very old.

            lateDays = Number of days that must have passed since a mailer
              was sent before we'll consider the lack of response to
              require a remailing.

            singleId = ID of a single document to be remailed.
              It must qualify for remailing.
